Demigame
===========================

A 'game' very much in progress.

What will it be?
---------------------------

Here's what I'm thinking at the moment:

1. A top down 2-d shooter mocking doom, with 
   pistols, shotguns, and of course the BFG.

2. The map should spin around the player, and the player
   should always face front. 

3. Lots of explosions.

Running Demigame
---------------------------
1. Install pyglet for python2. (Ubuntu)
      sudo apt-get install python-pyglet

2. Clone this project
      git clone https://github.com/CLaverdiere/demigame.git

3. Run demigame.py
      cd demigame
      python demigame.py
